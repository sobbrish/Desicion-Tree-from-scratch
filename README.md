"# Desicion-Tree-from-scratch" 
This is an Assignment from the course Compsci 361 in uoa where I had to make a decision tree as part of mechine learning algorithims by scratch to process mushroom datas from the UCI machine learning repository. The goal is to train part of the mushroom data to create a decision tree and using it to predict if a mushroom is poisonous or not.
